#Data Imputation and Classification Performance
Project Overview
This project focuses on the process of imputing missing values in a dataset and evaluating the performance of a classification model after the data has been processed. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database which contains medical data for predicting the presence of diabetes in individuals. Various imputation techniques such as mean, median, mode, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are applied to handle missing values, followed by the training and evaluation of a classification model.

Key Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
The first step involves inspecting the dataset and analyzing missing values. Initially, the dataset contains no missing values, but simulation is applied to introduce missing data. This process helps in evaluating the performance of different imputation methods.

2. Missing Data Analysis
After introducing missing values through simulation, a summary of missing data is generated. The analysis is performed on each column to understand the extent of missing data, which will help in selecting appropriate imputation techniques.

3. Imputation Techniques
To handle missing data, four different imputation techniques are applied:

Mean Imputation: Missing values are replaced with the mean value of the respective column.
Median Imputation: Missing values are replaced with the median value of the respective column.
Mode Imputation: Missing values are replaced with the most frequent value (mode) of the respective column.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: A more sophisticated method that fills in missing values by considering the closest neighbors in the dataset.
4. Model Training and Evaluation
After imputing the missing values, a classification model is trained to predict the outcome variable (whether the person has diabetes or not). The model’s performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

5. Classification Performance Results
Confusion Matrix: Shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: Displays precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (diabetes and no diabetes).
Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the classification model.
6. Final Outcome
After evaluating the performance of the classification model, the accuracy was found to be 99.87%, indicating that the imputation techniques, especially KNN, effectively handled the missing values and did not significantly impact the model’s predictive power.
